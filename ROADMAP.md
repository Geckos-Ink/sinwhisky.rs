# Research roadmap

## Implemented foundation

- Standalone Rust library and numeric CLI; standard library only.
- Reusable triplet analysis with circle/line models, local coordinates, aperture,
  branches, and unwrapped angles.
- Separate uniform-x compatibility and repaired original angular interpolation.
- Frozen-reference, analytic, error-bound, coverage, CLI, and live cross-validation.
- In-memory mono segment experiment that reuses fitted circles and reports error.
- Optional local audio comparisons with anti-alias decimation and bitrate controls.
- `test_music.sh`: configurable encoded-bitrate reduction, block-based Rust
  sample-rate upscaling, and WAV/FLAC output for full tracks or excerpts.
- Rust continuous circle transforms (analytic angular, numerical uniform) and
  descriptor-based discrete Fourier bins, with independent numerical tests.
- Optional NumPy circle/subarc/Fourier lab with versioned, bounded SWR1 experiment
  streams, residual quantization, raw fallback, byte/error measurements, and
  raw/delta/line/FLAC controls. See [method and results](docs/COMPRESSION.md).
- Prepared periodic `AngularFrame` with analytic AFT bins and fractional
  evaluation, independent of the existing resampler's blending policy.
- AFT/FFT benchmarks on 513 Beethoven windows, numeric integration checks,
  frequency/phase differences, scaling plots, spectrograms, and animated spectra.

## Current focus: angular Fourier transform

1. Improve conditioning for almost-flat arcs and extreme radii, with independent
   numerical checks; do not confuse a waveform change with integration error.
2. Profile and reduce the O(N²) full-spectrum cost, including cached kernels,
   phase recurrences, selected-frequency queries, and approximation error budgets.
3. Compare against dense-sampling FFTs of the same angular curve at matched
   numerical error. The present native FFT benchmark computes a different target.
4. Broaden signal/scale coverage and study periodic boundaries, alternative arc
   joins, explicit continuous windowing, and a separately specified inverse.
   No improved frequency resolution or recovered high-frequency claim is established.

## Next: establish quality and cost

1. Use varied music, speech, transients, silence, and synthetic signals; compare
   both modes with linear and bandlimited interpolation. Add blind listening
   trials and spectral metrics. Short excerpts from one recording are not enough
   to rank quality.
2. Measure fitting/synthesis/segment-search CPU and memory before optimizing.
3. Evaluate circle candidate reuse over longer ranges, merging/refitting, and
   continuity at segment boundaries. Keep changes separate from compatibility mode.

## Further codec experiments

1. Quantize circle geometry (currently float64) and **remeasure decoded error**,
   including branch/extent changes. Compare coarse parent fits against the tested
   extrapolation of local-triplet circles; keep refitting explicitly separate.
2. Improve the experimental residual coder and global byte search; measure larger
   blocks, delta-coded child parameters, and sparse Fourier residual budgets.
   Residual/raw trials exist; they do not yet establish a circle-specific advantage.
3. Design a stable format only after the tool-local SWR1 trials justify it. SWR1
   has explicit framing, limits, and malformed-input tests; add fuzzing and broader
   cross-platform round trips before treating any parser as safe for untrusted data.
4. Investigate predictive/delta parameter coding, entropy coding, stereo coupling,
   perceptual weighting, block boundaries, seekability, and streaming latency.
5. Only claim compression/bitrate after counting full headers, models, and residuals;
   only claim lossless coding after exact round-trip tests across the stated domain.

## Other planned work

- Native WAV CLI, sample-rate metadata, and explicit multichannel processing.
- Validate other platforms and add CI; choose a minimum supported Rust version.
- Address uniform-x branch mismatch with a new named policy, never silently change
  the compatibility behavior.
- Study FLT separately using a tested least-squares solver and calibration model.
- Publish/extract the folder into its own Git repository when requested; package
  publishing remains disabled until its API and validation policy are ready.
